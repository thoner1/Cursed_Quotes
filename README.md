## Description
#### The purpose of this project is to create a function in javascript that will scramble inspirational quotes from historical figures and turn them into nonsensical sentences by the following options:

1. Modify 1 of or up to all 4 of the parameters listed by entering as 'string' format. For a total of 15 possible combinations between 2 nouns and 2 verbs.

2. Simply input the number '1' in the function parentheses to parse a random, cursed quote that changes all 4 parameters randomly.
